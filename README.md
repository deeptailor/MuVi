## Features & Implementation

###Quick search

Users can search for their favorite music videos in the most minimalistic way. Just enter a search term and click on the video to start playing. No annoying pop-ups or advertisements.

###User Experience

One of the primary goals of this project was to create a smooth, desktop-app like user experience in the browser. This was largely accomplished via simple UX design.

User testing was also completed to fine-tune application layout and interactions.

##Future directions

MuVi was designed and built in under 2 days, and as such there's still a lot of room for expansion. Future steps for the project are outlined below.
